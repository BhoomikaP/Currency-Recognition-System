# Currency Recognition System

Welcome to the Currency Recognition System project! üåêüí∞

This project is designed to recognize and classify different currencies using computer vision techniques. Built using OpenCV for image processing, Flutter for the mobile application, and Flask for the backend server, this system provides a seamless and efficient solution for currency recognition on both mobile and web platforms.

## Features

- **Currency Detection**: Automatically detect and recognize the currency denomination from input images.
- **Classification**: Classify currencies into different categories based on their denominations.
- **Real-time Recognition**: Perform currency recognition in real-time using the mobile application.
- **Web Interface**: Access the currency recognition system through a web interface for enhanced usability.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library for image processing and currency detection.
- **Flutter**: Cross-platform framework for building mobile applications.
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for building backend server applications.
- **Python**: Backend logic and server-side scripting language.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend development technologies for the web interface.

## System Architecture

The Currency Recognition System consists of the following components:

- **Mobile Application**: Built using Flutter, the mobile application provides real-time currency recognition capabilities.
- **Backend Server**: Implemented using Flask, the backend server handles currency recognition requests and communicates with the OpenCV module.
- **Web Interface**: Allows users to interact with the currency recognition system through a user-friendly web interface.
